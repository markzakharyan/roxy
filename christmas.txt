Roxy-

I just wanted to take a moment to wish you a very Merry Christmas and to let you know how much you mean to me. You are really my best friend (and now, my girlfriend :D) and I have no idea what I would do without you.

You have been there for me through all the ups and downs, always offering a listening ear and patiently helping my through my horrendous college apps. You make me laugh when I need itâ€¦ you are actually a funny female.

I hope that the Christmas festivities bring you all the joy, love, and happiness that you deserve. Thank you for being such an amazing person and for making my life brighter every day.

Good luck with the Persians tomorrow.

Merry Christmas and Allahu Akbar.

Mark
